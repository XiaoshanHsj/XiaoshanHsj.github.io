## 💬 Biography
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, China, supervised by [Prof. Xunying Liu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-liu-xunying/). Previously, I received a B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Sichuan University (SCU), Chengdu, China, in 2021.

My recent research interests focus on speech processing and recognition, including multimodal speech recognition and self-supervised learning pre-trained speech fundation models. I'm also interested in generative AI and integrating speech with large language models.
